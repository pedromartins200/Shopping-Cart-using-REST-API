My implementation
###################

A simple client application using a REST API for the backend.

When the user is not logged in, I am using a simple session cart. When the user register and logins for the first time, I put the content of the session cart in a database.
From then on, we only deal with the API for every backend request.

This makes the application very portable.

The system allows to add items to the cart, update the quantities, order the cart content, view cart items, add a voucher (discount) to the order. Also items are displayed according to their category.

In the future, a stock management system could be done and token base authentication for the API, but it seemed overkill to me.

I used codeigniter 3, guzzle for the API requests, and phil sturgeon's rest server. I used php 7.3.7 but 7.0+ may work.


Keep in mind the base_url (check application/config/config.php) and also the database configurations (application/config/development/database.php). Base url is what gives trouble when people import codeigniter projects.

API Usage
###################

First thing you should do is register in the API, which will return you a user ID and API key.
With this combination, you can add items to the cart, update, delete, remove items and also order the cart content (with voucher option).

Without an API key you can view products in store and respective categories. 
Again, a token base authentication is more "secure" but its not necessary for a demo application.

You can use POSTMAN to check the API. The API output is JSON.

API Documentation
###################

Use 'admin' => '1234' for credentials.

This is a demo API with a demo client application.
There maybe plenty of bugs. This was purely done for demonstration purposes.
